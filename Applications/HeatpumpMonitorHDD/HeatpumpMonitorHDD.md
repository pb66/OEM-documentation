# Heatpump Monitor (local HDD)

**(emonTx v3, Raspberry Pi, Emoncms V8, Local harddrive installation)**

This guide details how to build a heatpump monitor with local data logging and visualisation accessible in the same way as you would access your home router on your local LAN. It uses the OpenEnergyMonitor emonTx V3, a Raspberry Pi with an RFM12Pi expansion board and a connected harddrive. Emoncms is installed locally on the raspberrypi for logging and viewing the data.

## System overview

## Parts list

Here are the parts you will need, most of them are available from the OpenEnergyMonitor shop.

    1x emonTx V3 pre-assembled
    1x 100A max clip-on current sensor CT
    1x AC-AC Power Supply Adapter - AC voltage sensor (Both UK and Euro plugs are available)
    4x Encapsulated DS18B20 Temperature sensors

    1x Raspberry Pi (Model B) - Web-connected Base Station
    1x RFM12Pi - Raspberry Pi Base Station Receiver Board
    1x Blank SD Card
    1x (optional) RaspberryPi case, this one is nice: Pimoroni Berryblack Case
    1x Harddrive with SATA to USB converter
    1x Powered USB hub (for powering the harddrive)

You might also need:

    1x 5V DC USB Power Adapter (UK Plug)
    1x Micro-USB cable
    1x Ethernet cable
    1x USB to serial programmer
    
Note: it's important that the frequency (868Mhz / 433Mhz) of the chosen modules match each other and is a legal ISM band in your country.

## System setup

The OpenEnergyMonitor hardware listed above all come pre-assembled, no soldering is required. However for this particular configuration we need to change the default firmware on the emonTx in order to gain the benefit of the new addition of accumulated watt-hours calculation on the emonx which increases the accuracy and reliability of the energy measurement.

Changing the EmonTx firmware

1. Start by following the: setting up the arduino anvironment guide

2. Click on File > sketchbook > OpenEnergyMonitor > emonTxFirmware > emonTxV3 > 
RFM12B > Examples > emonTxV3_continuous_kwhtotals_noeeprom. This will load the 
firmware example that both uses the higher accuracy continuous sampling code by 
Robin Emley and the watt hour calculation code mentioned above.

3. Set the frequency of your emontx at the top of the sketch/firmware and nodeid 
if you wish to change it. Plug up your emonTx v3 with a usb to serial programmer 
and click on Upload.

**Continuing with the hardware installation:**

Place or mount your emontx near your meter cabinet, the emonTx V3 comes with wall mounts as can be seen in the example installation above.

Plug in the CT sensor into the emonTx first before clipping it around the mains wire and before powering-up the emonTx. Clip the sensor around either the live or neutral wire of the circuit you wish to measure. (Don't clip around both as the magnetic fields will cancel).

Plug in the AC-AC Voltage adapter this both power's the emonTx and is used for sampling the AC mains voltage. A red light should now appear near the AC-AC adapter input and start flashing once every 10 seconds. Thats the emonTx set up! The emonTx can also be powered by batteries or from DC power source. See the emonTx technical wiki for info on using alternate power sources and interoperating the red LED behaviour

Plug the RFM12Pi hardware expansion module onto the Pi's GPIO pins taking care to align up pin 1, the RFM12Pi should be connected to the GPIO pins connector closest to the edge of the pi.

_Uses emonhub to link rfm12pi to local emoncms as well as having the ability to forward the data to multiple remote services_
